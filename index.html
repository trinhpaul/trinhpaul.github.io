    <h3>Hello! Welcome to my personal website! Currently the purpose for this website is to figure out the ins and outs of HTML! So please bear with me.<br /> With that being said, my name is Paul Trinh from the University of Oklahoma. I currently have aspirations to learn and hopefully become a professional in the cybersecurity field with consulting in mind! Most of these classes I have taken in my time at OU was very beneficial and I look forward to learning more within these last classes as well. Other than that, please check out my website.</h3>
