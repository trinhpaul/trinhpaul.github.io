            <h3>I've always had a fascination with technology ever since I was a kid as I was always in awe by how easy and practical the technology has in our lives. This translated into wanting to learn more in the field of computers/gaming.<br /> Being the quiet nerdy kid at school, I decided to simply immerse myself in the world of technology and never looked back again.</h3>
